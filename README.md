# Project_1_Amazon_Clone_HTML
# Amazon Clone (HTML & CSS Only)

This is my **first project**, a simple **Amazon website clone** built using only **HTML and CSS**. This project focuses on layout, structure, and styling — without using any JavaScript. It's a front-end-only static replica of the Amazon homepage.

## 🔨 Built With

- HTML5
- CSS3

## 🎯 Features

- Responsive design layout (partially)
- Navigation bar similar to Amazon
- Hero section and product showcase
- Footer section with multiple column links
- Hover effects and basic styling

> ⚠️ **Note:** This is not a fully functional website. It is a visual/static clone intended for learning purposes only.
